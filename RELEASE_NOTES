Apache ODE Release Notes
========================

Apache ODE 1.3.5 includes about 20 bug fixes and performance improvements.

Apache ODE 1.3.5 requires Java 1.5.x or higher. The WAR distribution can 
run in most J2EE servlet container. The JBI distribution should be able 
to run in any JBI container but has only been tested with ServiceMix 3.x
and latest ServiceMix 4.x (OSGi bundle) so far. See the BUILDING file if you 
want to build your own distribution from the source release. 

The performance improvements affect XPath 2.0 processing in assign activities
or transition conditions and makes it up to 10 times faster than ODE 1.3.4.
